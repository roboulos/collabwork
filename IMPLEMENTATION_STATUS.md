- Tested with curl commands
- Tracks clicks per shareable link
- Auto-publishes jobs at 30 clicks threshold

**Status**: ‚úÖ Backend implemented and tested

### 4. Morning Brew View Toggle
**PRD Requirement**: Admin needs to see what Morning Brew sees

**Implementation**:
- Added toggle switch in admin dashboard toolbar
- Switches between all jobs and MB curated jobs
- Uses `/api:microapp/morningbrew/list-all-brands` endpoint
- Maintains all functionality (edit, remove, add priority)

**Files Modified**:
- `/components/data-table/data-table-toolbar.tsx` - Added toggle UI
- `/components/job-table-enhanced-v3.tsx` - Added conditional data loading
- `/lib/xano.ts` - Added `listMorningBrewJobs` method

## üöß In Progress / Partially Complete

### 1. Title Formatting Integration
**Status**: Backend ready, frontend integration pending

**What's Done**:
- `/api:microapp/morningbrew/format-title` endpoint exists
- Added to service layer (`formatJobTitle` method)

**What's Needed**:
- Button/action to trigger title formatting
- UI feedback when title is formatted
- Update display to show formatted title

## ‚ùå Not Started / TODO

### 1. Morning Brew Editor Dashboard
**PRD Requirement**: Separate dashboard for MB editors

**Needed Features**:
- Copy shareable link button with formula display
- Read-only view of curated jobs
- Filter by brand/community
- Status management workflow
- Bulk operations

**Estimated Components**:
- `/app/morningbrew/page.tsx` - New dashboard page
- `/components/mb-job-table.tsx` - Specialized table for MB editors
- Authentication/role checking

### 2. Source Deletion Detection
**PRD Requirement**: Background task to detect when feed sources are deleted

**Needed Implementation**:
- Xano background task to check partner endpoints
- Mark `is_source_deleted = true` when 404/gone
- Notification system for admins
- Prevent broken links in newsletters

### 3. Error Handling Improvements
**Current Issues**:
- 500 errors from Xano APIs need better handling
- Added retry mechanism but needs comprehensive error boundaries
- Toast notifications need persistence options

### 4. Production Integration
**Needed**:
- Integrate click tracking into production job endpoints
- Add proper analytics/reporting
- Performance optimization for large datasets
- Caching strategy for MB views
